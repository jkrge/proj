# CS:GO Case Web Template

This project is a minimal Flask application that provides a template for managing and opening CS:GO style cases.

## Features
- Admin panel for full CRUD management of cases with skins, chances, and price.
- User interface to open cases and see the result.
- Data persistence via SQLite database (`cases.db`).

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install flask`.
2. Run the app: `python app.py`.

The application will create `cases.db` on first run.
